# EZPlace
EZ Place or Easy Place is an android application which makes the placement process in colleges easy and transparent.

## Some information related to the scope of the project:
1. In colleges, there are placement cells. TPO(Training and Placement Officer ) is part of the cell. 
2. PR(Placement Representative): There are some students who talk to the TPO on behalf 
of all the students. They are called PRs. There can be multiple PRs.
3. TPO conveys the PRs regarding the new companies arriving at the college for hiring.
4. The PRs convey this information further to the students. 
5. The PRs take care of further hiring rounds like conveying the date of scheduled rounds, 
filtering the students on the basis of company’s criteria, conveying the results to the students, etc.

## Problem:
The tasks of Training and Placement Cells and the Placement Representatives(PRs) are quite tedious. 
The TPO has to convey the details to the Placement Representatives. The PRs handle a lot of tasks at 
the same time. PRs are also students who have to prepare for the placements. Along with that, they 
also play all the responsibilities of the PRs.
From the students’ perspective, the placement process is sometimes not transparent. The results of some
companies are delayed, or their current status in the hiring process is not clear to them or delayed. 

## Solution:
A dedicated android application EZ Place for the placement process in companies. This app makes the 
task of both the parties easier. The TPO/PRs just have to update the details in the app. These details
will be notified to the students. The status of different companies’ hiring process can be tracked in 
the app. The students will be kept updated regarding any new companies, new rounds or results. 

## Initial setup in the app:
1. TPO registers using the sign up as TPO button.(Here the college is registered too)
2. Now the students of the college can register by choosing their college.
